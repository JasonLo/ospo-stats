    "- Utilize GraphQL for Efficiency: GraphQL allows you to request exactly the data you need, reducing unnecessary data transfer.\n",
    "- Public Schema for Data Structure: This [public GH GraphQL schema](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/public-schema) is quite comprehensive.\n",
    "- Implement Graceful Retry for Rate Limits: Since GitHub's GraphQL API enforces rate limits, implement a retry mechanism that respects these limits to handle requests gracefully without hitting the rate limit. Refer to the rate limits [documentation]((https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/rate-limits-and-node-limits-for-the-graphql-api)) for guidance.\n",
    "- Batch Queries by Year due to Max Results Limit: The maximum number of results you can fetch in one query is 1,000. To work around this, segment your queries by year or another logical division to retrieve all desired data without exceeding this limit.\n",
    "- Review and Adjust the Base Query as Necessary: [Existing query](ospo_stats/query.py) may need some changes, especially for handling data updates efficiently. Given the brief runtime of 3 minutes for the entire crawl, the current setup seems fine.\n",
